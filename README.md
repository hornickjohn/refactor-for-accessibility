# Horiseon Webpage Refactor

## Description

In this project I navigated side-by-side through the given HTML and CSS docs and scanned for anything that could be rewritten to be more concise or efficient. Along the way I also discovered a couple of bugs, and added a couple of features. There is now an icon for the page, and the left-right-left format of the floating images in the content section are extensible to larger numbers of articles. 

In addition to these types of refactoring, I also overhauled the div tags with semantic elements for better structure and accessibility. These changes had to be reflected in the CSS as well.
